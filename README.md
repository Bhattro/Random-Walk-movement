Suppose we have a square box with a wall dividing the box into two equally sized parts. In one part we have a gas where the molecules are uniformly distributed in a random motion fashion. At t= 0 we remove the wall. The gas molecules will now move around and eventually fill the whole box. This physical process can be simulated by a 2-D random walk inside a fixed area A  (in reality the motion is three- dimensional, but we only simulate the two-dimensional ). Use the program from either  to simulate the process for A= [0,1]x [0,1]. Initially, place 1000 particles at uniformly distributed random positions in [0.0.5]x [0.1]. Then start the random walk and visualize what happens. Simulate for a long time and make a hardcopy of the animation (an animated GIF file, for instance). Is the end result what you would expect.
